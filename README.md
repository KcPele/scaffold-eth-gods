# 🎨 Scaffold-ETH x Tailwind

Scaffold-ETH uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) out of the box for it's design system. This is perfect for quick scaffolding and fast frontend experimentation. Scaffold-ETH can also be used with any UI framework, though.

**Scaffold-ETH x Tailwind** uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework quickly becoming the default choice for new projects. It does not have ready-to-go components like modals and buttons but is packed with classes to make your own design system easily.

**Scaffold-ETH x Tailwind** serves as a starting for using Tailwind with Scaffold-ETH and also doubles as showing what is needed to remove Ant Design from the project. Currently, **Scaffold-ETH x Tailwind** has a reskinned application shell, wallet modal, dev UI, account header, light/dark theme, address input, and ether input. These are enough reskinned components in Tailwind for a user to start building the rest of their app with Tailwind CSS!

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenpslade/scaffold-eth-tailwind
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-tailwind
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-tailwind
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-tailwind
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app
